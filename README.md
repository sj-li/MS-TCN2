# MS-TCN++: Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network for Action Segmentation (TPAMI 2020)

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the paper [MS-TCN++: Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09220.pdf).

## Environment
Python3, pytorch

## Training:
* Download the [data](https://mega.nz/#!O6wXlSTS!wcEoDT4Ctq5HRq_hV-aWeVF1_JB3cacQBQqOLjCIbc8) folder, which contains the features and the ground truth labels. (~30GB) (If you cannot download the data from the previous link, try to download it from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3625992#.Xiv9jGhKhPY))
* Extract it so that you have the `data` folder in the same directory as `main.py`.
* To train the model run `sh train.sh ${dataset} ${split}` where `${dataset}` is breakfast, 50salads or gtea, and `${split}` is the split number (1-5) for 50salads and (1-4) for the other datasets.

## Evaluation
Run `sh test_epoch.sh ${dataset} ${split} ${test_epoch}`.
